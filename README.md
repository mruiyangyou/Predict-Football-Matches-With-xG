# Predict-Football-Matches-With-xG

This repository contains the code and analytic steps to derive the final prediction model based on machine learining and statistical models. 
Most of codes(web scraping, data wragnling, time series and machine learning) are written in python and statistical analysis are writtin in R. 
Compared with normal match result prediction model, the project focus on the appliaction and usage of [xG(expected goals)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_goals). 

## Web Scraping
All the football data are from two websites.

1. Mqtch data: <https://understat.com/>
2. Fixture data: <https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php>

## Data Wragling

## Model selection
